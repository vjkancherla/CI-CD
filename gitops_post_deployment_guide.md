# GitOps Post-Deployment Testing: Architecture Options

## Executive Summary

GitOps fundamentally changes CI/CD pipeline architecture by introducing asynchronous, decoupled deployment processes. Traditional pipelines can no longer execute post-deployment tasks because they lose visibility into when deployments actually complete. This document outlines five architectural patterns to solve this challenge while maintaining security best practices.

## The Problem

### Traditional CI/CD Flow (Linear & Synchronous)
```
Code Push ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Post-Deploy Tests ‚Üí Notifications
```
Each step waits for the previous one to complete. The pipeline has full control and visibility.

### GitOps Flow (Asynchronous & Decoupled)
```
Code Push ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Update Manifests ‚Üí [PIPELINE ENDS]
                                    ‚Üì
                      [ArgoCD Syncs Asynchronously]
                                    ‚Üì
                    [Post-deployment tasks orphaned]
```

### Core Challenge
Your CI/CD pipeline loses visibility and control after the git push. It cannot determine:
- When deployment actually occurs
- If deployment succeeds or fails  
- When applications are healthy and ready
- When to execute post-deployment tasks

### Security Constraint
**Zero-Trust Principle**: CI/CD pipelines should have no access to Kubernetes clusters, and applications in Kubernetes should have no network access to CI/CD systems.
