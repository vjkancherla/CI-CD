RELEASE FLOW BRANCHING STRATEGY
==================================================================

Release Flow is a branching strategy built upon Trunk-Based Development. It ensures a structured approach to development and releases, providing:
- A release-driven workflow
- Core benefits of Trunk-Based Development
- Short-lived feature branches with frequent code integration, reducing conflicts
- Pull-requests for structured review and validation before merging
- Release branches to separate development efforts from production-ready code

------------------------------------------------------------------
BRANCHES
------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Mainline (develop)**: Latest development changes and continuous integration target
- **Feature branches**: Short-lived development branches merged ONLY into the trunk (`feature/TASK-11`)
- **Release branches**: Long-lived branches created from trunk (`release/3.2.x`)
- **Fix branches**: Created for defect resolution, merged back into mainline or release (`bugfix/TASK-22`, `hotfix/TASK-32`)

------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASES
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Releases are built, tested, and promoted through a structured path-to-production.
- Each library, component, service, or deployment follows an independent release cadence.
- Releases can be abandoned when necessary, ensuring efficiency.
- A minimum number of active releases must be maintained to reduce overhead.

------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSIONING
------------------------------------------------------------------

Semantic versioning is **mandatory** ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE FLOW IN GIT
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Feature branches**
1. `feature/TASK-60` created from trunk at tag `6.4.2-SNAPSHOT`
2. Another feature branch `feature/TASK-61` is created during development
3. `feature/TASK-60` merged into trunk, increasing minor version → `6.5.0-SNAPSHOT`
4. `feature/TASK-61` merged into trunk, further increasing minor version → `6.6.0-SNAPSHOT`

------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGFIXES
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bugfixes on trunk**
1. `bugfix/TASK-65` created at `6.10.1-SNAPSHOT`
2. Merged into trunk, increasing patch version → `6.10.2-SNAPSHOT`
3. `bugfix/TASK-66` created at `6.10.2-SNAPSHOT`
4. Merged into trunk, increasing patch version → `6.10.3-SNAPSHOT`

**Bugfixes on release branch**
1. Release branch `release/3.0.x` is actively supported.
2. `bugfix/TASK-68-release-3.0.x` created from `3.0.0`
3. Merged, increasing patch version → `3.0.1`
4. Bugfix identified for trunk, branch `bugfix/TASK-68-trunk` created.
5. Code transported/adapted for trunk inclusion.
6. Merged into trunk, increasing patch version → `3.1.1-SNAPSHOT`

------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE RELEASE FLOW
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. `feature/TASK-1` merged into trunk, increasing minor version → `1.4.0-SNAPSHOT`
2. Release branch `release/1.5.x` created → `1.5.0`
3. Trunk minor version increased → `1.6.0-SNAPSHOT`
4. Bugfix `bugfix/TASK-5` merged into release branch, increasing patch version → `1.5.1`
5. Bugfix identified for trunk, transported/adapted, merged.
6. Major/breaking change merged, updating version → `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
7. Bugfix merged into both `release/1.5.x` and trunk.

------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changes are developed independently from mainline/release branches.
- Code is validated before merging.
- Feature changes merge ONLY into mainline.
- Bugfixes/hotfixes merge into mainline or release branches when necessary.
- Code is **only** released from release branches.
- Feature branches should be short-lived.
- Repository scope MUST be adhered to—no downstream implementations.

------------------------------------------------------------------
LIBRARY & COMPONENT RELEASES
------------------------------------------------------------------

Every feature merged into trunk **can** trigger a release:
1. CI/CD automatically creates a **release branch**.
2. Pipeline builds artifacts and tags commits.
3. **Release branch is terminated immediately** after artifact creation.
4. If required, terminated release branches can be restored for bugfixes (`release/5.8.x` was restored for `bugfix/TASK-53`).

------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSIONING & SNAPSHOTS
------------------------------------------------------------------

Versions evolve across different stages:
- **Snapshot versions** are created for trunk, feature, and fix branches.
- **Release versions** are created **ONLY** from release branches.

Example flow:
1. `feature/TASK-80` creates artifact `8.1.0-feature-TASK-80-SNAPSHOT`
2. Another commit updates `8.1.0-feature-TASK-80-SNAPSHOT`
3. `feature/TASK-80` merged into trunk, creating `8.2.0-SNAPSHOT`
4. Release branch `release/8.2.x` created → `8.2.0`
5. Commit tagged → `8.3.0-feature-TASK-80-SNAPSHOT`
6. Bugfix `bugfix/TASK-81` creates `8.3.0-bugfix-TASK-81-SNAPSHOT`

------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Feature/Bugfixes**
1. Code branch created from mainline.
2. Code changes made and pushed.
3. Pull-request raised to mainline.
4. Merged after validation.

**Hotfixes**
1. Locate affected release branch.
2. Create fix branch from release branch.
3. Code changes made and pushed.
4. Pull-request raised to release branch.
5. Merged after validation.
6. Cherry-picked to:
   - Mainline
   - Other active release branches

**Releases**
1. Code branch created from mainline, based on feature tag.
2. Branch pushed to repository.
3. No direct changes made.

------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE DEPRECATION
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Releases no longer in production or abandoned **will be deleted**.
- Deleted release branches **can be restored** using their Git tags.
