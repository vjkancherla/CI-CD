Releasing/Deploying to Production 
====================================

Once CI and CD are completed for the Trunk or Release branch, we are ready to release the code to Production

A Separate, specific, Jenkins pipeline must be created for this. The pipeline should accept the GIT COMMIT HASH of the code to release.

The pipeline will contain the following stages, with "Approval Gates" for each stage:

See https://github.com/vjkancherla/the_ideal_pipeline/blob/main/jenkinsfiles/post-merge/Jenkinsfile for the full pipeline

stage("Deploy-To-UAT") {
      when {
        // skip this stage unless on main branch
        branch "main"
      }
      steps {
        approve_deploy("uat")
        deploy("uat")
      }
    }

    stage("Verify-Deployment-To-UAT") {
      when {
        // skip this stage unless on main branch
        branch "main"
      }
      steps {
        verify_deployment("uat")
